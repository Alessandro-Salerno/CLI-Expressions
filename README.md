# CLI-Expressions
CLI Expressions is a small and stupid CLI Version of the game [MATH EXPRESSions](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1953970/MATH_EXPRESSions/).
It is in **NO WAY** a **CLONE** and I highly encourage you to **BUY** the original game instead of using this, the devs deserve it. This is meant to be a C-Programming exercise: try to find vulnerabilities, improve the ocde (Trust me, there's plenty of stuff to fix) etc.
